This repository hosts a collection of CPU scheduling algorithms implemented in C++. Each algorithm is designed to simulate and optimize task scheduling on a CPU. 

Algorithms Implemented:
1. Round Robin (RR): A preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice.
2. Deadlock Detection: Algorithms to detect and resolve deadlocks among processes.
3. Scan Scheduling: Implements the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm for optimizing disk head movements.
4. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): A preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process with the smallest remaining burst time is selected for execution.
5. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF): A disk scheduling algorithm that selects the disk I/O request closest to the current head position.

Compile and Run: 
Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and execute the compiled program to observe simulation results for each scheduling algorithm.
